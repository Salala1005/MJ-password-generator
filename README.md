# MJ-password-generator

## Description

In password generator project, I have created function to get password option so I can gather the user's input which will include minimum of one criteria.
With user's input, password will generate randomly.
To avoid unselected criteria that can appear in password, I made empty pasword and all charaters to start and only user's input will be saved.
