# MJ-password-generator

## Description

In password generator project, I have created function to get password option so I can gather the user's input which will include minimum of one criteria.
With user's input, password will be generate randomly.
To avoid unselected criteria that can appear in password, I made empty pasword, all charaters first and only user's input will be added in the password function.
